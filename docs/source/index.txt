meme_get
====================================


This is a library that provides a high-level abstraction for extracting memes from popular online websites. Currently, we support extracting memes from:

* `quickmeme.com <http://www.quickmeme.com/>`_
* `memegenerator.net <https://memegenerator.net/>`_
* `Memes subreddit <https://www.reddit.com/r/memes/>`_ from Reddit.

Here is a short example::

    >>> a = RedditMemes()
    >>> meme_list = a.get_memes(100)
    >>> for meme in meme_list:
    >>>     print(meme.get_title())

Why do we care about memes?
----------------------------

According to `Wikipedia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_meme>`_, an Internet meme is "an activity, concept, catchphrase or piece of media which spreads, often as mimicry, from person to person via the Internet." In our case, we care about a specific format of meme: one that takes the form of an image macro and captions.

We find these memes interesting because they are inherently simple. Yet with the right captions and image combinations, memes can become viral in a few hours. (See `Bad Luck Brian <http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/bad-luck-brian>`_) We think it might be interesting to investigate into these phenomenons.
